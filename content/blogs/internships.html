<p>I witnessed the immense potential within the data analytics field as a Business Analytics student at SUFE and LBS.I learned fundamental business knowledge and gained specialized business analytics skills through courses such as <em>Operational Management</em>, <em>Data Mining</em>, and <em>Regression Analysis</em>. Later, I applied my knowledge and skills into real-world practice through in-class projects and internships at Unilever and eBay. These experiences affirmed my passion for future career path in business analytics.</p>
<p>During the six months at <strong>Unilever</strong>, I worked on many projects and experienced how analytical methods facilitate the marketing decision-making process. I analyzed customer propensity for future purchase trends based on their purchase and browsing history. Based on this information, I trained a GBDT model to search for the best target audience for precision marketing. After obtaining the target audience profile, I used the OneMedia KOL evaluation system to better understand KOL marketing’s mechanism. By sorting products into eight categories and selecting attributes using stepwise regression, I assessed KOL’s performance data within each category. By identifying top KOL characters from various perspectives, including user demographics and customer preference, I ultimately provided suggestions for follow-up advertising channel strategies such as TikTok. As a result, the selected KOL performances exceeded our target, and the impression delivery was 107%. The click-through-rate increased from 0.71% to 1.19%, and ROI increased from 5.21% to 6.76%. Cultivating an ongoing relationship between a brand and its customers can form a virtuous cycle that sustains growth. This internship helped me develop more realistic and applicable insights when dealing with analytics problems. I later incorporated what I’ve learned from this experience into a successful class project.</p>
<p>All of my previous experiences helped me land my latest internship as a consumer market insights intern at <strong>eBay</strong>. In general, my responsibilities were in three areas:
1. Help with an overall eBay data transfer project, providing SQL support in Hadoop to ensure data accuracy.
2. Calculate GMV and COUPON values based on business needs using SQL.
3. Connect the Hadoop database to analytics software such as Tableau, R, and Python, enabling data analysis and visualizations on a larger scale and higher efficiency.
I utilized R Shiny to create an innovative and interactive web application to increase internal data extraction speed. Specifically, I designed an interface that allows users to enter a few custom entries such as email address and user id; based on their entries, the application automatically processes the request and pulls up relevant transactions within seconds. My dashboard helped internal teams increase their efficiency, as it allowed staff without a technical background to easily and quickly access their target data. My internship at eBay developed my coding skills in different programming languages, and I learned the advantages of each language in various application environments compared with previous practices.</p>
