<h2>Self-introduction of Yuting Wu</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m <strong>Yuting Wu</strong>, currently a London Business School, and my major is <em>Master in Analytics and Management</em>.</p>
<p>In college, I learned fundamental business knowledge through courses such as <em>Marketing Analytics</em>, <em>Data Mining</em>, and <em>Regression Analysis</em>. Later, I applied my knowledge and analytics skills, such as python, R and sql into real-world practice . in-class projects cover marketing, machine learning, operations, finance and other fields. My undergraduate studies in business analytics provided me with a broad understanding of many aspects</p>
<p>Besides having achieved outstanding academic performance, I have also completed 6 demanding internships at leading firms:
- <a href="https://www.unilever.com.cn/">Unilever</a>
- <a href="https://www.ebay.cn/">eBay</a>
- <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/">Strategy&amp;</a>
- <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/">BCG</a>
- <a href="https://www.meituan.com/">Meituan</a></p>
<p>From these experiences, I found myself want to focus my career on becoming an expert in applying data for marketing analytics, and I am confident that the MAM offered by LBS will help me realize my dreams and capabilities.</p>
