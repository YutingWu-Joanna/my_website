## Self-introduction of Yuting Wu

I'm **Yuting Wu**, currently a London Business School, and my major is *Master in Analytics and Management*. 

During my study life in LBS and SUFE, I learned fundamental business knowledge through courses such as *Marketing Analytics*, *Data Mining*, and *Regression Analysis*. Later, I applied my knowledge and analytics skills, such as python, R and sql into real-world practice . in-class projects cover marketing, machine learning, operations, finance and other fields. My undergraduate studies in business analytics provided me with a broad understanding of many aspects while LBS delivers an interactive classroom learning environment that ensures I can gain practical experience through Lodnon-lab, internships, courses and etc.

Besides having achieved outstanding academic performance, I have also completed 6 demanding internships at leading firms:
- [Unilever](https://www.unilever.com.cn/)
- [eBay](https://www.ebay.cn/)
- [Strategy&](https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/)
- [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/)
- [Meituan](https://www.meituan.com/)

From these experiences, I found myself want to focus my career on becoming an expert in applying data for marketing analytics, and I am confident that the MAM offered by LBS will help me realize my dreams and capabilities.
