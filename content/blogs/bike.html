<p>The curves are flattening in May and June 2020 compared to previous years, implying less bikes are being rented per day. In early 2020 Covid-19 hit the world and the first wave of infections arrived around April and May 2020. People were put in an unprecedented situation with living through a pandemic. Many people were afraid to go out, in fear of catching the virus, the consequences of which have not yet been fully researched.<br />
In a world where people are generally afraid of going out, it is likely that people also donâ€™t want to rent public bikes which have been used by numerous individuals that could potentially carry the virus. Consequently, bike rentals in May and June went down with people trying to touch as little as possible things to reduce the likelihood of catching the virus.</p>

<p>Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?<br><br />
Generally speaking, expected values are computed by using the mean. The mean takes into account all values, even outliers, and therefore provides a good estimation of future values. The median also takes into account all values, but chooses the middle value, which might not accurately present future data.<br />
Just in very skewed distributions, it might make sense to use the median to prevent outliers from skewing data, but I believe in this case the mean should be the most precise metrics. Furthermore, those two graphs were using the average, we used the same in order to properly replicate the graph.</p>
